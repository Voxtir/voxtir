  Like when Milley&apos;s talking about, oh, you were going to try to do a coup.

  They were trying to do that before you even were sworn in. That&apos;s right.
  Trying to overthrow your election. Well, with Milley, let me see that.
  I&apos;ll show you an example. He said that I wanted to attack
  Iran.<timestamp-button timestamp="00:00:25.78"></timestamp-button> Isn&apos;t
  it amazing? I have a big pile of papers. This thing just came out. Look. This
  was him. They presented me this. This is off the record, but they presented me
  this. This was him. This was the Defense Department and him. We looked at
  some. This was him. This wasn&apos;t done by me. This was him. All sorts of
  stuff. Pages long. Wait a minute.<timestamp-button
    timestamp="00:00:50.72"
  ></timestamp-button>
  Let&apos;s see here. Look at this. Yeah. I just found, isn&apos;t that
  amazing? This totally wins my case, you know. Except it is highly
  confidential. This is secret information. Look at this.

  ><timestamp-button timestamp="00:01:13"></timestamp-button> She&apos;d send it
  to Anthony Weiner for pervert. By the way, isn&apos;t that incredible? I was
  just saying, because we were talking about it. And he said, he wanted to
  attack Iran. And what?
